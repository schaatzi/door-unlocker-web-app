# GitHub Repository Setup Commands

## ALTERNATIVE METHOD - Manual Build & Deploy

Since GitHub Actions is having trouble building Flutter, let's use a simpler approach:

### Step 1: Build Locally (in PowerShell)
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\jerem\Documents\Flutter Projects\constructionimagetaker\DoorUnlockerSmartKeyApp\doorunlockersmartkeyapp"
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build web
```

### Step 2: Create gh-pages branch and upload
```powershell
# Create a new gh-pages branch for deployment
git checkout -b gh-pages

# Copy built files to root
xcopy build\web\* . /E /Y

# Remove Flutter project files (keep only web files)
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Flutter web app"
git push origin gh-pages
```

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to: https://github.com/schaatzi/door-unlocker-web-app
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Go to "Pages" in sidebar  
4. Under "Source" select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select branch: "gh-pages"
6. Select folder: "/ (root)"
7. Click "Save"

### Your app will be live at:
https://schaatzi.github.io/door-unlocker-web-app/

## This bypasses GitHub Actions completely and uses pre-built files!
